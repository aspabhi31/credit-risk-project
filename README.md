# Credit Card Default Risk Modeling

## Business Problem
Credit card issuers must decide which applicants to approve while minimizing credit losses.
This project builds a predictive model to estimate the Probability of Default (PD) and
supports approval decisions using risk-based strategies.

## Dataset
Public credit default dataset containing demographic, behavioral, and credit history features.

## Objective
- Predict Probability of Default (PD)
- Evaluate model performance using risk-appropriate metrics
- Demonstrate how model outputs support approval decisions
